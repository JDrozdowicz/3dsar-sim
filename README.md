# 3dsar-sim
Open Source 3D Synthetic Aperture Radar Simulator

This is an Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Simulator. This is a SAR signal simulator, which means its output is a range-compressed radar signal, and not a SAR image. Its main purpose is planning and verification of SAR missions.

The simulator works in Octave and MATLAB. See "demo_simple.m" for usage.
