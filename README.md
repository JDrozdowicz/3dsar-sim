# 3dsar-sim
Open Source 3D Synthetic Aperture Radar Simulator

This is an Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Simulator. This is a SAR signal simulator, which means its output is a range-compressed radar signal, and not a SAR image. Its main purpose is planning and verification of SAR missions. This is not general purpose radar simulator, as it ignores the Doppler effect that is not used in SAR processing.

The simulator works in Octave and MATLAB. See "demo_simple.m" for usage.
